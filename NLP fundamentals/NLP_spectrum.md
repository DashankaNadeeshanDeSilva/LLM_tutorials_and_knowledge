1. Text Processing & Linguistic Fundamentals
Text Preprocessing

Tokenization: Splitting text into words (word-level) or subwords (subword-level).
Normalization: Lowercasing, stemming, lemmatization, removing punctuation, and handling special characters.
Stopword Removal: Filtering out common but semantically insignificant words (e.g., “the,” “and,” “of”).
Linguistic Concepts

Morphology: How words are formed and how they relate to each other.
Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Labeling each token with its grammatical role (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
Syntax & Parsing: Understanding the syntactic structure of sentences (dependency parsing or constituency parsing).
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., persons, locations, organizations).
Why it matters: Proper text preprocessing and a grounding in linguistic basics are necessary for any NLP system. They directly affect the downstream performance of more advanced models.

2. Traditional Machine Learning for NLP
Bag-of-Words (BoW) & TF-IDF

Simplistic but effective text representation methods (especially for traditional classifiers).
Often used with machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes for tasks like text classification.
Rule-Based Systems

Early NLP systems relied heavily on handcrafted rules and dictionaries.
Though less flexible than modern methods, they can be very precise in controlled domains.
Why it matters: These approaches provide foundational intuition on feature extraction and classification for NLP. They also help you understand the evolution toward neural methods.

3. Word Embeddings & Distributed Representations
Word2Vec

Introduced the concept of learning vector representations for words (e.g., Skip-Gram, CBOW).
Captures semantic and syntactic relationships (e.g., “king” - “man” + “woman” ≈ “queen”).
GloVe (Global Vectors)

Combines global word co-occurrence statistics with local context-based learning.
Produces interpretable word vectors with linear substructures.
fastText

Incorporates subword information, helpful for morphologically rich languages and OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words.
Why it matters: Embeddings form the backbone of modern NLP systems by translating discrete text into continuous vector spaces, enabling neural network consumption.

4. Neural Networks & Sequence Modeling
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Vanilla RNN: Processes sequences token by token, keeping an internal hidden state.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU: Solve the vanishing/exploding gradient problem and capture long-range dependencies.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for NLP

Effective for text classification or other tasks with local features (e.g., sentiment analysis).
Often combined with recurrent or attention-based architectures.
Attention Mechanisms

Allows a model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
The precursor to the Transformer is widely used in seq2seq tasks (e.g., machine translation).
Why it matters: Understanding RNNs, LSTMs, and attention is crucial for historical context and for building an intuition about sequence-to-sequence modelling and how we arrived at Transformers.

5. The Transformer Architecture
Self-Attention

Replaces recurrent operations with parallelizable attention layers.
Computes relationships between all tokens in a sequence simultaneously.
Positional Encoding

Injects the notion of word order into a model that otherwise processes tokens in parallel.
Encoder-Decoder Structure

The encoder transforms inputs into a higher-level representation; the decoder generates the output sequence from this representation.
Why it matters: Transformers revolutionized NLP by enabling large-scale parallel training, resulting in state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks.

6. Large Language Models (LLMs)
Pre-Transformer Language Models

n-gram LMs and RNN-based LMs: Early statistical language models.
Set the stage for the idea of predicting the next token or word.
Foundational Transformer-Based LLMs

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Uses masked language modelling for pretraining; excellent for understanding-based tasks (e.g., classification, NER, QA).
GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) series: Uses unidirectional (autoregressive) modelling for text generation; widely used in generative tasks.
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): Treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems, flexible for many tasks.
Other Notable Models: RoBERTa, XLNet, ELECTRA, ALBERT, Megatron, PaLM, LLaMA, etc.
Training Paradigms

Self-Supervised Learning: Using unlabeled data (e.g., next-token prediction, masked-language modelling).
Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning: Pretrained models adapted to specific tasks with less labelled data.
Instruction Tuning & RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): Techniques to make large models more aligned with user instructions and human preferences.
Prompt Engineering

Designing or automatically learning prompts to guide LLMs for zero-shot or few-shot task-solving.
Emerged as a powerful technique to leverage large pretrained models without full fine-tuning.
Why it matters: LLMs have become the backbone of modern NLP applications, from chatbots and content generation to advanced question-answering and reasoning systems.

7. Core NLP Tasks & Applications
Text Classification

Sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic classification, etc.
Approaches include fine-tuning BERT-like models or using zero-/few-shot with LLMs.
Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Detecting and classifying entities (persons, organizations, locations, etc.) in text.
Machine Translation (MT)

From statistical phrase-based methods to Neural Machine Translation (NMT) based on Transformers.
Summarization

Extractive vs. Abstractive approaches.
Advanced LLM-based methods can generate human-like summaries.
Question Answering (QA)

Extractive QA (finding a span within text) vs. Generative QA (free-form answer generation).
BERT-like models excel at extractive QA; GPT-like models can be fine-tuned for generative QA.
Information Extraction

Relation extraction, event extraction, and knowledge graph population.
Dialogue & Conversational AI

Task-oriented dialogue systems vs. open-domain chatbots.
Use of LLMs for dynamic, context-aware conversations.
Text Generation

Creative writing, summarization, code generation, data-to-text, and more.
GPT and other decoder-only models are dominant in generative tasks.
Why it matters: Each of these tasks has unique nuances and historically used specialized models, but LLMs increasingly unify solutions within a single model architecture.

8. Advanced Topics & Practical Considerations
Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, ROUGE, perplexity, etc.
Human Evaluation: For tasks where automatic metrics fall short (e.g., open-ended generation).
Data Augmentation & Active Learning

Methods to improve model robustness by expanding or curating training datasets.
Interpretability & Explainability

Techniques like attention visualization, saliency maps, and LIME/SHAP for understanding model decisions.
Bias & Fairness in NLP

Recognizing and mitigating biases in training data or model outputs.
Ongoing research on building inclusive, fair language systems.
Efficiency & Deployment

Model compression (quantization, pruning, distillation) to reduce size and inference cost.
Serving LLMs in production (latency, memory footprint, GPU/TPU usage).
Multimodal NLP

Joint processing of text and other modalities (e.g., images, speech, video).
Security & Adversarial Robustness

Understanding how models can be attacked (e.g., adversarial inputs, prompt injections), and designing safeguards.
Why it matters: As NLP systems are deployed in real-world applications, considerations like efficiency, fairness, interpretability, and security become critical.

9. Building & Experimenting with Models
Frameworks & Libraries

PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, Stanford CoreNLP, etc.
Provide ready-to-use pretrained models and utilities for tokenization, training, and evaluation.
Experiment Design & Best Practices

Reproducibility, hyperparameter tuning, and robust error analysis.
Keeping track of data splits, random seeds, model checkpointing, etc.
Scaling Up

Distributed training for large models.
Handling massive datasets, multi-GPU/multi-TPU training.
Why it matters: Practical skills in implementing, fine-tuning, and experimenting with modern NLP models are essential to bringing theories and ideas to life.

10. Staying Current
