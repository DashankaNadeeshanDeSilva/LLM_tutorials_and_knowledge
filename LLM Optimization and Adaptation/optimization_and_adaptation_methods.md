1. Model Fine-Tuning and Adaptation
These methods adapt a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains:

Fine-Tuning: Training a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, task-specific dataset to refine its behavior for that domain (e.g., ChatGPT fine-tuned for customer support).
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Adapters: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that modify only small, task-specific layers while keeping the majority of the model frozen.
Prompt-Tuning and Prefix-Tuning: Techniques that adapt a model's behavior by learning task-specific prompts or token prefixes without modifying the main model weights.
2. Model Compression and Optimization
These techniques reduce the computational or memory requirements of LLMs:

Quantization: Reducing the precision of model weights (e.g., from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers) to decrease memory usage and improve inference speed with minimal accuracy loss.
Pruning: Removing less important parameters or connections in the model to reduce its size and computation without significantly degrading performance.
Knowledge Distillation: Training a smaller "student model" to replicate the behavior of a larger "teacher model," enabling lightweight deployments while retaining most of the teacher's performance.
3. Deployment and Inference Optimization
Techniques to improve efficiency during deployment and inference:

Caching and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combining LLMs with retrieval systems to provide context-specific responses efficiently.
Sparse Models: Using sparsity in model architecture or inference (e.g., Mixture of Experts) to activate only relevant parts of the model for a given input.
4. Transfer Learning and Multi-Task Learning
Methods that leverage knowledge from a pre-trained model to adapt to new tasks:

Multi-Task Fine-Tuning: Training a model on multiple related tasks to improve generalization across tasks.
Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning: Using a pre-trained model's inherent capabilities to perform tasks with little or no task-specific training.
